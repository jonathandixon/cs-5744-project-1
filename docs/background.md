According to the 2019-2020 APPA National Pet Owners Survey, 67% of U.S. households own a pet, which equates to 84.9 millions homes. [1] The type of pets includes but not limited to dog, cat, bird, freshwater fish, saltwater fish, horse, and reptile. However, there is no centralized medical record system existing at this time to help shelters, veterinarians, and pet owners access a complete medical record of the animals and update the record. Current systems that track medical information for animals are fragmented. Veterinarians and adoption shelters maintain separate records, which makes it difficult to piece together an animal's history. If an animal transfers between veterinarians or shelters, their medical history may not travel with them. This system aims to solve this problem through a centralized medical record system.
